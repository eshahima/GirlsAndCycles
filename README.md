# Girls & Cycles  

## 📖 Description  
**Girls & Cycles** is a project dedicated to raising awareness about menstruation and empowering women to advocate for themselves through accessible information and engaging data visualizations.  

Hi! My name is **Esha Himagirish**. I created Girls & Cycles because I recognized the lack of clear, accessible resources online regarding menstruation — an issue rooted in the lack of diversity in the tech and healthcare industries. Having personally experienced symptoms without realizing they were related to my period, I wanted to make sure other girls didn’t have to go through the same confusion.  

While it currently focuses on menstrual cycles, my vision is to expand it to highlight broader women’s healthcare issues such as:  

- The lack of published data on women’s health  
- Technology that fails to account for women’s needs  
- Underrepresentation of women in clinical trials leading to dangerous data gaps  

These challenges have real consequences — from women being unable to advocate for themselves in medical settings to AI models failing to address female-specific health concerns. **Girls & Cycles is a step toward changing that.**

## 🔮 Menstrual Cycle Simulator (New Work)

As a recent extension of Girls & Cycles, I developed an interactive menstrual cycle simulator that allows users to model how lifestyle factors may influence cycle length over time.

This simulator represents my current work on the project and applies concepts from my CS 124 coursework, moving beyond static data visualization into interactive, user-driven modeling.
## 🖥️ Interactive Simulator Webpage

**The simulator is embedded directly into the website, where users input stress levels, sleep hours, and weekly exercise to receive predicted cycle lengths across three consecutive cycles.** The simulator is designed to be **exploratory and educational**, not diagnostic, empowering users to **better understand their bodies** and **advocate for their health.**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used (Simulator)

- **Java** (initial modeling & OOP design)
- **HTML / CSS** (UI integration)
- **JavaScript** (logic translation & interactivity): **event-driven JavaScript to connect the simulation logic to the UI.**

## 📊 How I Made the Data Visualizations  
I used the **Menstrual Cycle Data** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikitabisht/menstrual-cycle-data) to create the graphs.  

- Cleaned and prepared the dataset using **Python**  
- Imported several Python libraries for data analysis  
- Created histograms and visualizations with **Matplotlib**
