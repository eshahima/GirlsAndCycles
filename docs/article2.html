    <a href = "https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/11/04-0367_article">78% of people with autoimmune diseases are women. </a> <a href="https://drmaggieyu.com/blog/understanding-autoimmune-flare-ups-before-menstrual-periods/">The menstrual cycle’s effect on the immune system is one of the reasons why the likelihood of having an autoimmune disease is higher in women than in men. </a> But exactly how does it cause flare-ups or worsening of these symptoms? And can the immune system affect the menstrual cycle?
    </p>
<p class = "parallax-text" style = "font-size: 20px;">
Cytokines, estrogen, progesterone, and antibodies fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle. <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/does-your-period-weaken-your-immune-system">These fluctuations cause the immune system’s functions to decrease making a person more receptive to infection. </a>Particularly, progesterone weakens the immune system, while estrogen boosts the immune system. This fluctuation occurs because the immune system wants to attack the fertilized egg, while the progesterone wants to protect it. Moreover, the immune system is amped up during the follicular phase and weak during the rest of the phases. These fluctuations in the immune system make women more susceptible to becoming sick from particular infections, especially in the middle of their cycle. On the other hand, people with autoimmune diseases or chronic conditions have flare-ups or increasing symptoms during menstruation. For example, Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis are linked to the cycle and tend to get worse before menstruation.

  <a href = "https://helloclue.com/articles/cycle-a-z/the-immune-system-and-the-menstrual-cycle">During the follicular phase, antibodies and estrogen are high, making women less susceptible to infections.</a> The levels tend to be high because estrogen connects to the outside of the cell acting as a defense against pathogens and increasing inflammation. Increased inflammation could eventually lead to the worsening of chronic diseases and prolonged exposure to it leads to cancer. The high levels of estrogen in the follicular phase affect women with autoimmune diseases by increasing symptoms or causing a flare-ups. Likewise, women with chronic conditions have an increase in symptoms, too.

  During ovulation, the estrogen and progesterone levels lower prompting a weakening immune system for the sperm to survive. Next, in menstruation, the inflammation levels increase again and estrogen levels are low which weakens the immune system. <a href="https://cora.life/blogs/blood-milk/how-the-four-phases-of-the-menstrual-cycle-may-affect-your-immunity">Around this time, symptoms for chronic and auto-immune diseases worsen too. 
     During the luteal phase, the progesterone levels increase and little to no inflammation occurs. Specifically, the increasing levels of progesterone causes the immune system to weaken. Women with chronic conditions see little to no symptoms.

  Just as the menstrual cycle affects the immune system, the immune system can affect the menstrual cycle. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-vaccines-can-temporarily-affect-menstruation-and-studying-that-matters/">For example, having a dose of a vaccine at a particular time in the cycle or during a cycle can affect when the next period arrives. </a>If a dose of a vaccine is taken during the cycle, the next period is delayed by half a day. If two doses are administered within the same cycle, the next period is delayed within 3 days. Specifically, if the vaccine is administered during the first half of the menstrual cycle, there’s an increased chance of a delayed period. This happens because the first half of the cycle is more sensitive to hormone fluctuations. <a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2023/covid-vaccine-doesnt-affect-menstruation/">Although cycles return to normal within two cycles, there are multiple long-lasting effects. For example, some people have a heavier or longer period after receiving the vaccine which occurs because the cytokines released after vaccination affect menstrual hormones. 
  </p>
<p class = "parallax-text" style = "font-size: 20px;">
  In conclusion, the fluctuating levels of progesterone and estrogen during the menstrual cycle affect autoimmune diseases by worsening symptoms and causing flare-ups. Additionally, the immune system affects the menstrual cycle by delaying or lengthening periods, among other long-lasting effects.
