      <p style= "font-size: 17px;" class = "parallax-text"> Hi! My name is Esha Himagirish. I created Girls and Cycles for a lot of reasons. Mainly, I recognized the lack of information and resources online due to a lack of diversity in the tech industry. Having personally experienced various menstrual symptoms without realizing they were related to my periods, I wanted to ensure that other girls didn't have to go through the same confusion. So, I combined both of my passions - computer science and biology - to create a website that raises awareness about menstruation and helps women advocate for themselves. While Girls and Cycles currently focuses on the menstrual cycle, my vision is to expand its scope to address more healthcare issues that women face. This includes the lack of data published on women's health, technology not accounting for women's needs, and women being underrepresented in trials leading to data gaps. These issues have significant consequences, leaving women unable to advocate for themselves effectively in medical settings and AI models to fail to address female-specific health issues. It's disheartening that it has taken so long for people to recognize and address these crucial issues. Together, we can work to change that!</p>

          <p style= "font-size: 15px;" class = "parallax-text" >A lot of things! I gathered information from credible sources like the Cleveland Clinic and Medical News Today. I developed those using the<a href= "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikitabisht/menstrual-cycle-data"> 'Menstrual Cycle Data' from Kaggle </a>, and I used Python to clean the dataset and create those awesome graphs. I used Canva to design the icons and logos but used paper and pencil to create wireframes. I curated the color and the font pallete for the website. </p>

Using Python, I cleaned the dataset and imported several Python libraries and the data. Finally, I created the histograms using the Matplotlib library.</p>
